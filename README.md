  - Choose from common apps or enter a custom app name
  - Set specific time ranges for blocking
  - Select which days of the week to enforce blocking
- **Complete Setup**: Generates all necessary LaunchDaemons, helper scripts, and cron configurations

### School Day Calendar (`calendar.html`)
- Interactive calendar to select school/work days
- Date range selection (2025-2035)
- Generates formatted `school_days.txt` file
- Click individual days or use "Select All" for bulk selection
- Export in the exact format needed for the scheduled blocking scripts

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Check if blocking is active
To verify if an app is currently being blocked:
```bash
sudo launchctl list | grep com.block.messages
```
Replace "messages" with your app name. If you see output, blocking is active. No output means blocking is not running.

### View logs (Scheduled Blocking only)
To see when blocking was enabled/disabled and school day checks:
```bash
cat /var/log/messages_block.log
```
Replace "messages" with your app name if you used a different app.

### Common Issues
- **Blocking not working?** Make sure you ran the setup script with `sudo`
- **Cron jobs not running?** Check that dates are properly formatted in `/usr/local/etc/school_days.txt`
- **App still opens?** Verify the LaunchDaemon is loaded with the command above
